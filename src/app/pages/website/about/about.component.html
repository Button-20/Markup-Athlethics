      Markup Athletics is a non-governmental organization dedicated to
      empowering African high school student athletes with the tools they need
      to succeed both academically and athletically. Our platform serves as a
      bridge between talented student athletes in Africa and college coaches in
      the US. We believe that excellence in sports and education can go hand in
      hand, and we are passionate about creating opportunities for young talents
      to study and compete at renowned institutions in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Markup Athletics, we have a team of dedicated professionals who verify
      each student athlete on the platform, ensuring that coaches have access to
      the most talented and well-prepared candidates. Our analytical tools help
      showcase the skills and potential of our students, making it easier for
      coaches to identify the perfect fit for their teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are more than just a platform; we are a family for our student
      athletes. We partner with an educational consulting firm to provide
      guidance and support for exam preparation and visa processing. Once our
      students are accepted into US colleges, we continue to monitor their
      progress, connecting them with mentors and established athletes to help
      them thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ultimate goal is to create lasting opportunities for our student
      athletes, not only during their college years but also beyond. We strive
      to assist them in securing professional sports contracts and becoming
      leaders in their respective fields. With the motto "Bringing the
      Advantage," we are committed to transforming the lives of African student
      athletes and leaving a positive impact on the world of sports and
      education.
